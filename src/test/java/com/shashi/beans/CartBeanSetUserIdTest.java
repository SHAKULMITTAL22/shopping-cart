Scenario 1: Valid UserId Assignment
Details:
  TestName: assignValidUserId
  Description: Validate that a valid user ID string can be assigned to the userId field without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setUserId method.
  Act: Call the setUserId method with a valid String ("user123").
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the userId field in the instance equals "user123".
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks if the userId is correctly assigned and stored. This is crucial to ensure the user identification is accurate for further processing or retrieval in the application.
Scenario 2: Null UserId Assignment
Details:
  TestName: assignNullUserId
  Description: Check the behavior when null is assigned to the userId field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setSaving method.
  Act: Call the setUserId method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the userId field is set to null.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test ensures that the class can handle null inputs for userId, which is important for avoiding NullPointerExceptions in other parts of the application that might use the userId.
Scenario 3: Empty String UserId Assignment
Details:
  TestName: assignEmptyStringUserId
  Description: Test setting the userId field with an empty string and verify that it stores the empty value correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Call the setUserId method with an empty string ("").
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the userId field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test checks if empty strings are handled correctly, ensuring that the system can deal with user inputs that might not necessarily be null but are still effectively "empty".
Scenario 4: UserId Persistence Across Instances
Details:
  TestName: userIdPersistenceAcrossInstances
  Description: Verify that setting a userId in one instance does not affect the userId in another instance of the same class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class.
  Act: Set userId on the first instance and check the userId on the second instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the second instance's userId remains null.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test verifies the independence of instance fields across different instances, which is essential to ensure that each object maintains its state without interference.
Scenario 5: UserId Assignment Impacts Only Specific Field
Details:
  TestName: userIdAssignmentSpecificFieldImpact
  Description: Confirm that setting the userId does not inadvertently change other fields within the class, such as prodId or quantity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set prodId to a specific value.
  Act: Set the userId and then check the values of prodId and quantity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that only the userId has changed and other fields remain unaffected.
Validation:
  Clarify that the test ensures field isolation within the class, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and avoiding unintended side effects during field assignments.
