Scenario 1: Valid InputStream Returned
Details:
TestName: checkValidInputStreamReturned
Description: Tests whether the getProdImage method returns a valid InputStream when prodImage is initialized properly. This scenario confirms that the method correctly handles and retrieves the InputStream member variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the prodImage field to a valid InputStream object.
  Act: Invoke the getProdImage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned InputStream is the same as the one set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test checks if the method returns the correct InputStream that was initialized, ensuring that the getter method is functioning as expected.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. A valid return of an InputStream is crucial for subsequent operations that might rely on this data, such as displaying or processing an image.
Scenario 2: Null InputStream Returned
Details:
TestName: checkNullInputStreamReturned
Description: Verifies that the getProdImage method returns null when the prodImage is not initialized. This scenario is important for understanding the method's behavior when encountering uninitialized fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class without setting the prodImage field.
  Act: Invoke the getProdImage method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned InputStream is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test checks if the method correctly handles and returns a null value when the InputStream is not initialized, which is an expected behavior for uninitialized objects.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Handling null values properly is essential to avoid NullPointerExceptions during runtime, thus ensuring the robustness of the application.
Scenario 3: InputStream Consistency Over Multiple Calls
Details:
TestName: checkInputStreamConsistency
Description: Ensures that multiple invocations of the getProdImage method return the same InputStream object if the prodImage field has not been altered between calls. This test checks for the consistency and idempotency of the getter method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the prodImage to a specific InputStream.
  Act: Invoke the getProdImage method twice.
  Assert: Assert that both returned InputStream objects are the same.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test verifies that the getProdImage method consistently returns the same object across multiple calls if no changes are made to the underlying data.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Consistency in returned values from getter methods is crucial for ensuring that the application state is stable and predictable.
