### Test Scenario 1: Set Valid Product ID
Details:
  TestName: setValidProdId
  Description: This test checks if the method setProdId correctly assigns a valid non-null, non-empty string to the prodId field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and prepare a valid product ID string.
  Act: Invoke the setProdId method with the prepared valid product ID.
  Assert: Confirm that the prodId field of the class instance is updated to the new value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the prodId field equals the input string, verifying that setProdId accurately sets the field. This is significant because setting the correct product ID is crucial for tracking and managing product-related operations in the application.
### Test Scenario 2: Set Product ID as Null
Details:
  TestName: setProdIdAsNull
  Description: This test verifies that the setProdId method can handle null input by setting the prodId field to null without causing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setProdId method with a null value.
  Assert: Check that the prodId field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the prodId field is null after the method call. This test is important to ensure that the application can gracefully handle null inputs, which might represent scenarios where a product ID is yet to be assigned or is unknown.
### Test Scenario 3: Set Product ID as Empty String
Details:
  TestName: setProdIdAsEmptyString
  Description: This test examines whether the setProdId method correctly processes an empty string by setting the prodId field accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setProdId method with an empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the prodId field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the prodId field is an empty string, confirming that the method handles empty strings correctly. It's crucial to ensure that the system can process empty strings as valid inputs, which might be used as placeholders or in initial states before a valid ID is available.
### Test Scenario 4: Check Immutability of Input String
Details:
  TestName: checkInputStringImmutability
  Description: This test ensures that changes to the input string after setting the product ID do not affect the already set prodId field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and a string variable with an initial value. Set the product ID using this string.
  Act: Modify the original string variable after the product ID has been set.
  Assert: Ensure that the prodId field remains unchanged and does not reflect the modifications to the string variable.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms the immutability of the string used to set the prodId, verifying that the prodId field retains its value even if the input string is altered post-method call. This test is significant for ensuring data integrity within the application.
These scenarios cover a range of inputs and their effects on the system, ensuring that the setProdId method behaves as expected in various situations, contributing to robust and reliable product management in the application.
