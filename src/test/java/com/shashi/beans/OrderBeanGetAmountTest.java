Scenario 1: Valid Amount Retrieval
Details:
TestName: testGetAmountWithValidAmount
Description: This test checks the functionality of the getAmount method to ensure it correctly retrieves the amount when a valid Double value is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the private field 'amount' to a valid Double value using reflection or a setter method if available.
  Act: Call the getAmount method to retrieve the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved amount matches the set value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the getAmount method correctly returns the exact Double value that was set in the 'amount' field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the amount is correctly retrieved is crucial for accurate financial transactions and reporting within the application.
Scenario 2: Amount Field Is Null
Details:
TestName: testGetAmountWhenNull
Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getAmount method when the 'amount' field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class without setting the 'amount' field, ensuring it remains null.
  Act: Call the getAmount method to retrieve the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the method handles null values correctly without throwing an exception and returns null as expected.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validating that null values are handled correctly is important to prevent unexpected crashes or behaviors in parts of the application that depend on this method.
Scenario 3: Amount Field With Negative Value
Details:
TestName: testGetAmountWithNegativeValue
Description: This test checks the behavior of the getAmount method when the 'amount' field is set to a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the 'amount' field to a negative Double value.
  Act: Call the getAmount method to retrieve the amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is the negative Double that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the getAmount method correctly retrieves negative values, which might represent refunds or credits in a financial context.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It is crucial to handle negative values correctly as they can represent different aspects of financial transactions, such as deductions or refunds.
Scenario 4: Consistency of Retrieved Amount
Details:
TestName: testGetAmountConsistency
Description: This test ensures that repeated calls to getAmount return consistent results when the 'amount' field has not been modified between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the 'amount' field to a specific Double value.
  Act: Call the getAmount method multiple times to retrieve the amount.
  Assert: Assert that all retrieved values are identical and match the initial set value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks for the consistency and reliability of the getAmount method over multiple invocations.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the method returns consistent results is important for reliability and predictability in financial calculations and displays within the application.
