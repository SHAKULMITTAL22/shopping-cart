Scenario 1: Set Positive Quantity
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveQuantity
  Description: This test checks whether the setQuantity method correctly assigns a positive integer to the quantity field of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setQuantity method.
  Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with a positive integer value.
  Assert: Assert that the quantity field of the instance equals the integer provided.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Here, we expect that setting a positive integer should correctly update the quantity field without any exceptions or errors, reflecting normal usage of setting item quantities in a transaction.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring that positive quantities are handled correctly is crucial for inventory and order management systems to function properly.
Scenario 2: Set Zero Quantity
Details:
  TestName: setZeroQuantity
  Description: This test verifies whether the quantity can be set to zero, which might represent special cases like out-of-stock or unavailability.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setQuantity method.
  Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with zero as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the quantity field of the instance is zero.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Asserting a zero quantity is important to handle cases where products might not be available temporarily or permanently, and this needs to be accurately reflected in the system.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Proper handling of zero quantity is essential for accurate reporting and management in inventory systems.
Scenario 3: Set Negative Quantity
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeQuantity
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setQuantity method when a negative integer is provided, which typically should not be allowed in standard inventory practices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setQuantity method.
  Act: Invoke the setQuantity method with a negative integer.
  Assert: Assert that the quantity field of the instance reflects a negative value, although in practical scenarios, this might raise an exception or ignore the input.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This test is crucial to verify that the system can handle or reject negative values, which are generally considered invalid in the context of quantities for transactions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring robust handling of incorrect or unusual input values like negative numbers is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing logical errors in inventory management.
These scenarios provide a comprehensive testing strategy for the setQuantity method, covering typical, edge, and erroneous cases, ensuring that the method behaves correctly across various possible input scenarios.
