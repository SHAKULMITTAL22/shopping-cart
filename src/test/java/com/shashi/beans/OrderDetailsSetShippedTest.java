Scenario 1: Set a typical shipped value
Details:
  TestName: setValidShippedValue
  Description: This test verifies that the `setShipped` method correctly assigns a typical positive integer value to the `shipped` field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setShipped` method.
  Act: Call `setShipped` with a positive integer value (e.g., 5).
  Assert: Check if the `shipped` field of the instance is set to the value passed.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensure that the `shipped` field is updated correctly when provided with a valid integer.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the method handles typical use cases correctly, reflecting accurate order shipment statuses.
Scenario 2: Set a zero as shipped value
Details:
  TestName: setZeroAsShippedValue
  Description: Test to ensure that the `setShipped` method correctly handles setting the `shipped` value to zero, which might represent scenarios like order preparation or pending shipment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Call `setShipped` with a value of 0.
  Assert: Verify that the `shipped` field is set to 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The `shipped` field can hold a zero value, potentially indicating no items shipped yet.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important for cases where orders are prepared but not yet shipped.
Scenario 3: Set a negative value for shipped
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeShippedValue
  Description: Tests the behavior of the `setShipped` method when a negative value is passed, which might be considered invalid in business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Call `setShipped` with a negative integer, e.g., -1.
  Assert: Check if the `shipped` field is set to this negative value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Whether the field accepts negative values, which could be indicative of an error or exceptional case in the application logic.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures robustness by testing potential error inputs and how the system records or rejects them.
Scenario 4: Set a large integer value for shipped
Details:
  TestName: setLargeShippedValue
  Description: This test checks whether the `setShipped` method can handle very large integer values without error, which might be used to test the upper limits of the system's capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Call `setShipped` with a very large integer value (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE).
  Assert: Verify that the `shipped` field is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method's ability to handle large values which might be relevant during stress testing or unusual business scenarios.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the system can handle edge cases involving unusually high shipment numbers.
These scenarios ensure a comprehensive test coverage of the `setShipped` method across typical, boundary, and exceptional values, which is crucial for maintaining robust and reliable order management functionality in the application.
